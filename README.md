# transformerless-power-supply
This project is a PCB design for a **Transformerless Power Supply** created using KiCad.  
It provides a compact and cost-effective way to power low-current DC circuits directly from AC mains without using bulky transformers.

# Features
Compact PCB layout using through-hole components
- Converts AC to regulated DC using:
  - Capacitor dropper (C4)
  - Full-wave bridge rectifier (D1â€“D4)
  - Filtering and regulation using LM7805 or LM7812
  - Protection diodes and discharge resistors
  - Indicator LED for output status
